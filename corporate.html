          <p>Please provide a list of design elements alongside their justifications:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A colour scheme (with HTML colour codes, which must be consistent with your final website)
              <em>&mdash; see the example below from the BUas brand book:</em>
              <ul class="list-unstyled">
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #ff971e;"></span>
                  #FF971E
                  <em><br>The orange color is mostly chosen because it radiates positive and happy vibes. It feels like sun, a warm feeling.&hellip;</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #5adae6;"></span>
                  #5ADAE6
                  <em><br>The blue is chosen because it is the complete opposite of the orange. This creates a more playfull feeling.&hellip;</em>
                </li>

                 <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #FFF3D5;"></span>
                  #FFF3D5
                  <em><br>We chose the beige as a background color, since white was to harsh and boring. This warmer color creates a more cohesent site, showing that ever part
                      that has this color is here intentional. &hellip;</em>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #00975d;"></span>
                  #00975D
                  <em><br>This is an accent color used throughout the website. This dark green color is also part of the logo. A darker color was needed on the site to create a clearer contrast, so to keep it as a whole, we chose the dark green color from our logo. &hellip;</em>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li> Other colors that were mentioned in our style guide, were appart form the images, not used for site element.</li>
                 <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #b6cd3a;"></span>
                  #B6CD3A
                  <em><br>The light green is used for the logo and images of the chameleon. &hellip;</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #df7884;"></span>
                  #DF7884
                  <em><br>The pink was used for the tongue of the chameleon.&hellip;</em>
                </li>


              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Font choices</li>
               <em class="font-example"> 'Delicious Handrawn' </em>We wanted a playful "handwritten" font for the titles that were used on the website. This font creates that playful "handwritten" effect, but it is still really clear what it says.
               <em class="font-example-two"> 'Lato' </em> For the rest of the site we chose a really simple and clear font. We wanted it to be modern, easy to read and "basic", so we could use more color and images without the site being hysterical.
            <li>User interface patterns (e.g. grids, carousels, menu organizations etc.)</li>
                  <em>We used a carousel to show the values of our company on the about site. We chose for a carousel, so people were able to look through the values, without having too much text on the page at one time. We added a carousel with buttons, so people can decide themselves how long they look at the values. &hellip;</em>
                    <em> <br>We kept the menu (navigation bar) really simple with only two buttons (if you do not count the corporate page). This is because we feel like there are no other pages needed and since the pages are relatively small, it is easy to find the content on the pages you want. If you have to scroll down a little bit more (funding tiers for example), we have added a button higher on the page, so it is easier for the users to find. &hellip;</em>


            <li>The structure of the <strong>navigation and content</strong> (e.g. how content units are distributed across pages)</li>
                     <em>HOME PAGE: The home page consists of a video at the top of the page, this is to have a moving element as soon as you open the site, so it really grabs your attention. Inside the video, there are two buttons that go to the funding tiers and the about page. The funding tiers is lower in the page, so you will be send down. The about page is a new page, so you will be sent to a new page. <br>Underneat the video (but partly overlapping with the video) is the information about the game itself. The information is partly overlapping the video, so it is clear that there is more information beneath, without having to scroll down. After the information about the came are the funding tiers. This is done with a bootstrap example of pricing. We used this example, because you were able to add some information and also a button to go to a different page.&hellip;</em>
                   <em><br>ABOUT PAGE: On the about page we start with the vision, so it is really clear for the people what we stand for as soon as you open the page. Beneath that is a carousel that contains the values. After the values is a part with the team information. We used another bootstrap example, because this example already contained three rounded images with text underneath. After the meet the team is a contact information. Here we stated all our contact information, but they are also links, so when someone clicks on them they will be sent to our social media immediately.&hellip;</em>
                      <em><br>NAVIGATION BAR: We choose to have a navigation bar without a background color. This is so it will not take too much attention of the page. The navigation bar contains the logo of the brand, a home button, a button to the about page. And a button to the corporate page.&hellip;</em>
                   <em><br>FOOTER: The footer contains the name of our company, and a link to our Instagram and mail. Therefore it is possible to get in contact with us from every page.&hellip;</em>
                  
            <li>Please relate these elements to other units, for example:
              <ul>
                <li>How does website design fit the <strong>values and personality of the brand</strong>?</li>
                         <em>The main value we kept in mind with making the site is fun. We used bright colors, to make it seem happy and colorfull. &hellip;</em>


                <li>How does website design fit the <strong>marketing and communication strategy</strong>?</li>

          <h4 id="production-3" class="mt-2">Testing Report</h4>
          <p>The proof of the testing can be found in appendix 1&hellip;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Your testing <strong>goals:</strong> ; The goal of our testing was to find out if everyting is easy to access. If the testers knew where they could find the information they wanted to get. And if it was clear to use, if the buttons were right and correct.</li>
            <li>Your testing <strong>methods</strong>, which includes information about:
              <ul>
                <li>The test&rsquo;s <strong>participants:</strong> We tested on three people, all withing the target audience. Two of them were younger parents with younger children and one was a little bit older, with children a little bit higher in the target group. We did this on purpose, to find out if it was clear for younger and older users.
                <li>The test&rsquo;s <strong>setting:</strong> The testing was at the house of one of our team members, since she personally knew the people that were going to test. The site was opened on the laptop of the tester, so when they sat down, the site was already opened for them.
                <li>The test&rsquo;s <strong>protocol:</strong> The test results were written down, but to have proof of the testing, pictures and photo's were taken. <br>There were several quesitons during the testing, wich were: <br>1. Can you find the information about the team members that are part of the team. <br>2. Can you find the information on what you get when you donate money. <br>3. Can you donate money for the first tier, so 10 euro's. <br> 4. You want to donate 20 euros, how will you do that?<br>5. You want to ask us a question about something that is not clear, can you ask us the quesiton/find the information you need to ask that question. <br>6. You want to know where Chameleon stands for, can you find that information? <br>7. Whas the site grabbing your attention when you first looked at it. <br>8. Is it a site that is fitting to our brand.
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Your testing <strong>results</strong>, which includes information about:
              <ul>
                <li>Positive and negative aspects of the UI/UX that have been identified, ranked by importance:
              <br> 1. The buttons at the top of the home page are usefull, because in the first look at the site, you can immediately choose where you want to go. You can be sent anywere on the site.<br> 2. There are some elements that do not look good when you make the page smaller. <br> 3. It is not possible to go back to the home page, when you opened the funding tier.<br>4. There was a page for the open tier, but there was no way of filling in the amount you want to donate.<br>5. It is nice that the pages are not too big, therefore it is easy to find the information you want to find.</li>
                <li>Improvements that have been implemented on the final website (or that would be implemented if doing so would be too complex):<br> 1. We added a "back" button to the page where people can fill in the information for the funding. <br> 2. We also added a field in the open tier checkout form, where you can fill in the amount you want to donate. <br> 3. If we would have been able to do it, we would make sure the the page looks good on every size screen. The two buttons on the home page, and the carousel on the about page do not look good on a smaller page. The rest of the elements we were able to change. So if it was not too complex for us, we would have make sure that the buttons and carousel also looked good.</li>

          <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5 corporate-title">Marketing</h2>
          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <p>CONTEXT
            <br>The marketing campaign is about the brand Chameleon, a children’s board game that is both educational and fun. Even though it is a children’s board game, our campaign is focused to appeal both children as well as the parents of the children, since they are eventually the people buying the product. 
            <br>
            <br> To reach this audience, we wanted to use Instagram and Facebook. During our research for the brand, information was gathered from interviews with our target group. During those interviews, our target group mentioned that they mostly use Instagram as a social media platform, for fun, but also as a place where they can find useful advice and products for their children. Moreover, Facebook is a platform that is used widely by our target audience. 
           
            <br>
            <br> THE MESSAGE
            <br>The main message of our marketing campaign is to convey that playing Chameleon the Game is an educational and entertaining game for kids, that can be played with the whole family. Playing board games is a fun way of connecting with each other. 
             <br>By presenting examples of the game cards, and emphasizing the brand values, we want to express that Chameleon the Game provides a unique and engaging experience that encourages learning and development for children. 
              <br>
             <br>The emphasis of the message is also to highlight our unique selling point, the monthly subscription on game cards. This enables parents to keep the game fun and fresh for their children, by having new playing cards every month. 
             <br>
             <br> In conclusion, the main intention is to convince parents that Chameleon the Game offers a simple and convenient approach to amuse their children month after month, while also fostering their development. 

             <br>
             <br> PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITIES 
             <br>
              <br>To be able to spread this message, we posted a variety of content on our social media profiles. 
              <br>
           <a href="https://www.instagram.com/chameleon_thegame/" target="_blank">Our Instagram account</a><br>
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100091246329842" target="_blank">Our Facebook account</a>
              <br>
              <br>The campaign started by introducing Camo the Chameleon, the brand’s mascot. With this mascot we wanted to create a lovable figure, that would make it easier for our followers to understand our values and message.

          <br>
          <p> We used Camo to emphasize the brand’s values. We made adjusted illustrations of Camo, the chameleon that is visible on our logo. These illustrations were a way of making our values visible. The idea was that Camo is the brand but introduces himself as a character. This way it is not just: “one of our values is introducing curiosity” But more: “ I am a curious chameleon”. This way, we wanted to have people connect more to the brand, by expressing our values in a visual appealing way.</p>

          <br>
          <p>Apart from posting our values through Camo the Chameleon, we also posted an Instagram reel on our page. By posting the reel, we wanted to make more engaging content for our followers. The reel included an image with actual children, with a text that is a message directed to the parents. The message emphasizes the company’s subscription service, which is our unique selling point. </p>

            <p>Moreover, we also experimented with two different ways of sharing the same content. We wanted to share examples of our question and task cards. One of the posts, was just an illustration of a task card, the second post was a picture of someone holding a question card. We wanted to find out which post would have more likes, comments, and reach.</p>

          <br>
          <p>Apart from the posts on our page, we also used Instagram stories to interact with our followers. We used stories to create involvement and a feeling of community among the audience. Polls were used to get input from our consumers and followers, which we could use to further develop the game and our marketing plan. We used this interactive strategy for raising brand recognition, but it also for creating a channel for continuing dialog between the brand and the intended market.<p/>

            <p>Lastly, we also posted hashtags with every post. We did this to reach even more people, that are not following us. Our tactic was to use very broad hashtags, so it we could reach as much people as possible.</p>
          <br>
          <p>THE OBJECTIVES
            <br>
            <br>  Reach objective: ‘On the 14th of April, we want to have reached at least 200 people on Instagram and Facebook.,’ 
           <br>On both Instagram and Facebook, it is possible to see the reached people. This means that you can find out how many people saw the content on your page. We feel like 200 is a doable goal for a brand that is just starting. 

           <br>
           <br>Affect objective: ‘With our content, we want the audience to feel happy, therefore we want to have a average of 65 likes on our posts on the 14th of April.’ 
         <br>We want to radiate our value fun, and therefore we want our content to be colourful and fun.  To find out if our followers like our content, we will measure the amount of likes we get. 
        <br>
        <br>Response objective: ‘At the 14th of April, we want that 20 people have clicked on the link to our website, that is shared on our Instagram page.’ 
       <br>We want to make our followers curious to our brand and product, therefore we want to know how many people actually take that extra step to open the site.
 


          
          <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
         <p>Throughout the duration of our marketing campaign, we discovered several important lessons that could improve our strategy and help us connect with our target audience more effectively.</p>

<p>Asking questions:
Asking questions in our posts and stories proved to be one of the most successful methods of creating interactivity, because it was a really engaging approach for our followers. We discovered that posts with questions in the caption generated comments, and with using this strategy, we could gain insightful feedback from our audience. </p>
         <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-12">

          <br>
           <br>
          <br>
          <br>

<p>Instagram reel:
The degree of engagement we were expecting from our Instagram reel was not achieved by its performance. Because Instagram reels have been more and more popular recently, we had initially expected the reel to be more successful. Reels frequently go viral very quickly since the algorithm tends to promote them more than regular posts. </p>
      <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-6">
            <img src="images/marketing/ex.13.jpeg" alt="Image 1" class="marketing-img img-fluid img-1">

          </div>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>

<p>Good first impression:
We discovered that we managed to reach the most followers at the beginning of our campaign. This emphasizes how crucial it is to make a good first impression and make sure the first few posts are compelling and engaging in order to draw the audience in. </p>

<p>Real people:
The post with the biggest reach, was part of an experiment we did.
We posted an illustration of a task card, and a picture with someone holding a question card. 
The post with the illustration reaches 24 people, 92% of them were followers.
The post with the picture of someone holding the card reached 34 people, 82% of them were followers.
This shows that the picture with real people reached more people, and more people that were not actually following us. Therefore, it might be a good idea to use more pictures with real people in the future, to also reach more people that are not following the account. </p>

          <br>
          <br>
          <br>



<p>Facebook:
During the project, Facebook has not really been used. An account is created, and the first post is posted, but other than that the focus was mainly on Instagram. Therefore, we missed a lot of opportunities in reaching more people. </p>

<p>Objectives:
Reach objective: ‘On the 14th of April, we want to have reached at least 200 people on Instagram and Facebook.’ 
Since we did not really use Facebook, we are going to focus on the reach on Instagram. This means that the reach goal on Instagram was 100 accounts.
We found out that we reached 54 accounts. And 21 of those accounts were not following us. 
This means that we did not reach our objective, but we think it mostly ha

          <br>

<p>Affect objective: ‘With our content, we want the audience to feel happy, therefore we want to have an average of 65 likes on our posts on the 14th of April.’ 
We came up with this goal, because we wanted to have the amount of likes to be 1/3 of our followers. 
Our goal was to have 100 followers on Instagram, and therefore an average of about 33 likes a post. This goal was not met since we also did not get 100 followers.
Our very first post got 23 likes, the most likes of all the posts on our channel. This was also the moment when we gained the most followers on our channel. 
When you take 1/3 of our followers, that would be around 11 likes. We did get around 7 to 9 likes per post. Which means that we are much closer to our goal of 1/3 likes. 
If we would have met our goal of followers, it would have been highly possible to also reach the goal of likes. </p>

<p>Response objective: ‘On the 14th of April, we want that 20 people have clicked on the link to our website, that is shared on our Instagram page.’ 
   We wanted that our followers, and the people that we reached would visit our website. Therefore we aimed for at least 20 people to click on the link that we shared on our Instagram page. We shared the link in our stories, so the change was bigger that people would see the link.
   17 people have clicked on the link in our story, to visit our website. This means that we almost reached our objective, even though the other two objectives were not reached and we therefore had reached less channels, and less likes on our posts. </p>

          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
         
<p>Because of our reflection on the learning points, we found some points that we would incorporate in the future:<br>
- Asking questions in captions and stories. Stay interactive with our followers and give them some input on our brand.
<br>- Post more pictures with real people. The post that reached the most people was one with real people, therefore we want to use this in the future and post more stuff with real people. 
<br>- Focus more on Facebook. Right now, we mostly focused on Instagram, and did not really post anything on Facebook. So, in the future, we want to post more on Facebook so we can reach more people there. 
<br>- Be more consistent with posting. We had a period of time where we posted less, so in the future we want to make sure that we really follow our posting agenda and stay consistent with posting. </p>

The game contains a monthly subscription. Every month, a new set of question and task cards will be delivered to your house, this keeps the game new and fresh.  That’s why our unique value proposition is keeping children engaged and entertained every month again. </p>
          

          <h4 id="management-2" class="mt-2">Validation of Assumptions</h4>
          <p>REFLECTION ON TRADEMARK<br>

After the problem interviews we came across multiple different problems that were amongst parents with young children. There were some big problems mentioned but a recurring problem was that parents had a difficulty with entertaining their children without the usage of digital devices. This is something we also thought of ourselves as problem before the interviews and therefore chose to make a question about this problem in the interviews. After the interviews it was something that all the participants agreed on and so we immediately chose to use this as a starting point for creating our trademark. After some discussion the best to execute this, and so on come up with the best solution for this problem, seemed to us to make a boardgame. But no ordinary boardgame. The best way to still keep it entertaining for children without the usage of digital aspects was in our eyes to release every month new cards that they game can played with. So it doesn't get boring for the children. We knew most of the alternatives for the problem were based on keeping the children entertained by giving them something new one in a while. So they keep themselves busy without using digital devices. <br>
<br>
REFLECTION AFTER SOLUTION INTERVIEWS<br>
After the first solution interview that I did in the early stages of our project we had to adjust the recommended age for the game to better suit the goal of our intended market. She expressed admiration for the idea but a legitimate concern about the game's suitability for children of the age of her younger one. Her younger child couldn't read the cards yet, so she would have to constantly watch over and help her. A sound effect that would read the cards to the players aloud was another solution that was put out during the interview. We later discovered, however, that some parents preferred their kids to play the game on their own, so they can also learn on how to read. And therefore, in order to maintain the children's sense of independence and self-discovery that the game offers, we chose not to execute this idea.
<br>
<br>
PIVOTS<br>
First pivot<br>
One of our first pivots, is the change in channels. We decide to  not continue with YouTube because it would be to hard to create, produce and publish YouTube content on a frequent basis besides the other social media. So instead of continuing with Facebook we only continued with the other social media. <br>
<br>Second pivot
Here we decided to not only focus on parents with young children in Netherlands but also in Europe. We made this decision because of the fact that the product, the game, is easily translatable and so it is easy to distribute it in other countries as it doesn’t include any cultural aspects. Secondly, the problem of rising digitalisation under young children is something that is probably not only occurring in the Netherlands.<br>
<br>Third pivot
Later on the website we added the option to sponsored/donate us. So naturally this wasn’t at the first version of the lean canvas. We decided to add this feature because of the extra revenue we could get from it. Also because chameleon has only one product that they can sell makes the company very dependent on that product. But with the revenue from sponsors and donations a little less. Logically this is also something that has been added to the Key Metrics. The social media disappeared at the Key Metrics because the followers and likes on social media weren’t important enough for us in correlation with the selling of the product.<br>
<br>Fourth Pivot
The problems that occurred at the problem interviews were as good as solved with the creating of our new board game as seen as outcome by the solution interviews. However after the solution interviews we stumbled upon some new problems that the contestants of these interviews gave us. Logically these problems came with new solutions we later figured out.
