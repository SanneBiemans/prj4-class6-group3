          <h4 id="production-1" class="mt-2">Design Elements</h4>
          <p>Please provide a list of design elements alongside their justifications:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A colour scheme (with HTML colour codes, which must be consistent with your final website)
              <em>&mdash; see the example below from the BUas brand book:</em>
              <ul class="list-unstyled">
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #ff971e;"></span>
                  #FF971E
                  <em>The orange color is mostly chosen because it radiates positive and happy vibes. It feels like sun, a warm feeling.&hellip;</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #5adae6;"></span>
                  #5ADAE6
                  <em>The blue is chosen because it is the complete opposite of the orange. This creates a more playfull feeling.&hellip;</em>
                </li>

                 <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #FFF3D5;"></span>
                  #FFF3D5
                  <em>We chose the beige as a background color, since white was to harsh and boring. This warmer color creates a more cohesent site, showing that ever part
                      that has this color is here intentional. &hellip;</em>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #00975d;"></span>
                  #00975D
                  <em>This is an accent color used throughout the website. This dark green color is also part of the logo. A darker color was needed on the site to create a clearer contrast, so to keep it as a whole, we chose the dark green color from our logo. &hellip;</em>
                </li>

              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Font choices</li>
               <em class="font-example"> 'Delicious Handrawn' </em> We wanted a playful "handwritten" font for the titles that were used on the website. This font creates that playful "handwritten" effect, but it is still really clear what it says.
               <em class="font-example-two"> 'Lato' </em> For the rest of the site we chose a really simple and clear font. We wanted it to be modern, easy to read and "basic", so we could use more color and images without the site being hysterical.
            <li>User interface patterns (e.g. grids, carousels, menu organizations etc.)</li>
                  <em>We used a carousel to show the values of our company on the about site. We chose for a carousel, so people were able to look through the values, without having too much text on the page at one time. We added a carousel with buttons, so people can decide themselves how long they look at the values. &hellip;</em>
                    <em> We kept the menu (navigation bar) really simple with only two buttons (if you do not count the corporate page). This is because we feel like there are no other pages needed and since the pages are relatively small, it is easy to find the content on the pages you want. If you have to scroll down a little bit more (funding tiers for example), we have added a button higher on the page, so it is easier for the users to find. &hellip;</em>


            <li>The structure of the <strong>navigation and content</strong> (e.g. how content units are distributed across pages)</li>
                     <em>HOME PAGE: The home page consists of a video at the top of the page, this is to have a moving element as soon as you open the site, so it really grabs your attention. Inside the video, there are two buttons that go to the funding tiers and the about page. The funding tiers is lower in the page, so you will be send down. The about page is a new page, so you will be sent to a new page. Underneat the video (but partly overlapping with the video) is the information about the game itself. The information is partly overlapping the video, so it is clear that there is more information beneath, without having to scroll down. After the information about the came are the funding tiers. This is done with a bootstrap example of pricing. We used this example, because you were able to add some information and also a button to go to a different page.&hellip;</em>
                   <em>ABOUT PAGE: On the about page we start with the vision, so it is really clear for the people what we stand for as soon as you open the page. Beneath that is a carousel that contains the values. After the values is a part with the team information. We used another bootstrap example, because this example already contained three rounded images with text underneath. After the meet the team is a contact information. Here we stated all our contact information, but they are also links, so when someone clicks on them they will be sent to our social media immediately.&hellip;</em>
                      <em>NAVIGATION BAR: We choose to have a navigation bar without a background color. This is so it will not take too much attention of the page. The navigation bar contains the logo of the brand, a home button, a button to the about page. And a button to the corporate page.&hellip;</em>
                   <em>FOOTER: The footer contains the name of our company, and a link to our Instagram and mail. Therefore it is possible to get in contact with us from every page.&hellip;</em>
                  


            <li>All these elements must be justified by referring to the theory <strong>and/or vocabulary</strong> of design</li>
            <li>Please relate these elements to other units, for example:
              <ul>
                <li>How does website design fit the <strong>values and personality of the brand</strong>?</li>
                         <em>The main value we kept in mind with making the site is fun. We used bright colors, to make it seem happy and colorfull. &hellip;</em>


                <li>How does website design fit the <strong>marketing and communication strategy</strong>?</li>
